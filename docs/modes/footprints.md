`Footprints` mode allows you to specify squares that track footprints / unit-movement on your map. These squares will 'darken' as units walk on them. (snow, mud, etc..)

- You can select squares on the map, and press `Enter` to make squares track footprints / unit-movement

- You can select squares on map, and press `Shift+Enter` to make squares not track foot prints / unit-movement

- You can select squares on map, and right click to open up context menu for options

- Compatible with {{sideControls("symmetry-mode")}} and {{sideControls("flood-fill-mode")}}
