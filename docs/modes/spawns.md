`Spawns` allow you to place the starting locations for players.

- This is where your Town Halls are placed in the beginning of the game (`melee` maps only)
- This is also where player cameras are centered on at the begining of the game.
- You are allowed to place Spawn Locations touching gemstones by enabling `Enable Unit Stacking`
- Currently every player requires a starting location. This requirement may be lifted in the future for `custom` maps.
