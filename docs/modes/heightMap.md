`Height Map` allows you to control the height map used on maps.

- This allows you to create cool effects such as craters on your maps.
- Units do less damage when attacking from lower ground to higher ground.
- Height map unfortunately does not effect fog of war and vision (only cliffs do).
- Height map also currently does not effect unit `xy` speed. (may change in future)
- Compatible with {{sideControls("symmetry-mode")}}
