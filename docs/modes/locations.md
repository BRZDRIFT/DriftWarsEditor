`Locations` mode allows you to define location positions for your map

- `Locations` can be referenced in `DriftScript` to define positions and sections of the map.
- You can rename a `Location` by selecting it and then pressing `Enter`.
- You can delete a `Location` by selecting it and pressing `Delete`.
- Locations are useful in custom scripting.
- Locaitions allow you to write `DriftScript` that functionally does:
    - `Give me all units at 'Location A'`
    - `Kill all units at 'Location B'`
    - Etc..
