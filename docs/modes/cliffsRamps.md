`Cliffs / Ramps` allow you to add cliffs and ramps to your map.

- Adding Cliffs
    - `Add Cliffs`: Allows you to add cliffs units can walk on.
    - `Add Closed Cliffs`: Allow you to add unwalkable cliffs.

- Adding Ramps
    - To create ramps, you need to 'assemble' them from smaller pieces.
    - Ramp pieces: `Left Ramp`, `Middle Ramp`, `Right Ramp`, `etc...`
    - `Important!` You can rotate Ramp pieces by pressing `R` when placing.
