The `Forces` dialog allows you to create `Forces` and assign `players` to those `Forces`

- A `Force` is a grouping of `players`
- `Players` that belong to the same `Force` does not necessarily mean they are on the same 'team'
- The information in this dialog is only used for `custom` game-type maps
