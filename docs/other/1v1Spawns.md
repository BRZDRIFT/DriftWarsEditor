- The `[1v1] Spawns` dialog allows you to set start locations for 1v1 matches.
- You can use this to restrict certain spawn location combinations (i.e. close-spawns)
- Duplicate spawn locations added to dialog will be optimized out when dialog closes.
- A value of `1` means `Spawn Location 1`, `2` means `Spawn Location 2`, etc..
- Having zero defined spawn locations is equivalent to allowing all spawn location combinations.
- This information is only used in `1v1` game mode.
