`Tags Per Force` dialog allows you to set restrictions for which `Tags` can be part of which `Forces`
- This also allows you to set a limit for how many `players` in a specific `force` can choose  specific `tag`. If you set the `Max Players` to `1`, then only one `player` in that `force` will be allowed to select that `tag`.
- The `Max Players` in `Tags Per Force` works together with `Max Players` in the `Tags` dialog to smartly limit `Tag` allocations to players.
- You must check the `Enable Per Force Tags` checkbox to enable this feature
- The information in this dialog is only used for `custom` game-type maps.

> It is up to you that you provide high enough `MaxPlayers` values so every player in the force can select a `Tag`. If not enough `Tags` can be allocated for all the players in the force, your map may be unplayable.
