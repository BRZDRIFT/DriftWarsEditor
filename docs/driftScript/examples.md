Probably the best way to figure out `.DriftScript` is by looking at examples and experimenting. Please have a look at the maps below:

- `/Dev/Maps/Custom/(5) Golemz.DriftMap`
- `/Dev/Maps/Custom/(8) LevelUpBound.DriftMap`

Feel free to look at the scripting code by opening them up in the map editor and going to: 
  
`Top Bar Menu --> Other --> Script --> /MapInit.DriftScript`  
and  
`Top Bar Menu --> Other --> Script --> /SimUpdate.DriftScript`

Good Luck.. and if you still need help message `BRZDRIFT` on Discord
